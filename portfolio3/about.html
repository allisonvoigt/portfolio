            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>My name is Allison Voigt and I'm a student at North Dakota State University.  I'm a double major in Interior Design and International Studies.  Recently, I've completed an internship with a firm called Evoke Projects in Sydney, Australia.  During this time, I improved my skills in SketchUp and AutoCad as well as learned basic skills in Photoshop, InDesign, and ArchiCad.</p>
            <p>Personally, I enjoy traveling and loved the experience I had abroad.  I spend a lot of time with my family and friends.  I am part of Alpha Gamma Delta here on campus, and that has helped me develop a vast amount of interpersonal, collaboration, and communication skills. </p>
